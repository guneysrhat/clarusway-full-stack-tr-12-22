# JS-CC-08: Sliding Window Maximum

## Assignment Statement

- Time to put your newly learned skills to work!

- This is an <mark>interview question</mark> asked by Google.<img src="google.jpg" alt="drawing" width="40"/>

- Given an array of integers and a number k, where 1 <= k <= length of the array, compute the maximum values of each subarray of length k.


## Submit

- Students will push the solutions to their own public GitHub repos.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this coding challenge, students will be able to;

- Analyze a problem, identify and apply programming knowledge for appropriate solution.

- Demonstrate their knowledge of algorithmic design principles by using JavaScript and Python effectively.

## Expected Outcome

###### For example; 

```
given array = [10, 5, 2, 7, 8, 7] and k = 3, we should get: [10, 7, 8, 8], since:
10 = max(10, 5, 2)
7 = max(5, 2, 7)
8 = max(2, 7, 8)
8 = max(7, 8, 7)

```
###### Example 2;
```
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
Explanation: 
Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7
```




## Problem Statement

- Make solution with JS

- Make solution with Python (optional)
