1. Bölüm Loops

//! Q-1
//? Ask the user to input a number. Check the input of the user, if it is not a valid number
//? then keep getting input from the user until provides a valid number.


//! Q-2
//? Write a JavaScript program to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) (OBEB) of two positive integers.


//! Q-3
//? Write a code that displays the factors (tam bolen) of a number entered by the user.

//! Q-4
//? Write a code to calculate the factorial of a number entered by the user.

//! Q-5
//? Write a code to find numbers that are divisible by 3 and 5, between 100 and 1000.


//! Q-6
//? Write a code that prints a multiplication table of numbers 1 to 10.


//! Q-7
//? Write a code to draw Whiteball and Powerball numbers for the Powerball lottery game. 
//? 5 Whiteball numbers are chosen from 01 to 69 and 1 Powerball number is chosen from 1 to 26.



2. Bölüm Functions

//! Q-1
//? Write a Function that takes 2 parameters (amount and rate) to convert currency.

//! Q-2
//? Write a JavaScript function that accepts an argument and returns the type.

//! Q-3
//? You are given a string and character. Write a function to check the string and find how many
//? times this character occurs in this string.
//? Example:
//? str = "Clarusway"         char = "a"       ===> result = 2 as "a" occurs 2 times in Clarusway

//! Q-4
//? Write a JS code to display Perfect Numbers from 1 to 1000.
//? A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself.
//? For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2 and 3 (excluding itself), and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number.


//! Q-5
//? Develop a guessing game. Randomly generate a number between 0-100. Ask the user to guess that number.
//? The user should have 5 chance to guess the number.
//? If the number entered by the user:
//? is greater than the random number then warn user to decrease,
//? is less than the random number then warn user to increase,
//? is equal to the random number then congratulate the user and tell in how many guesses did the user find the number
//? If user can't find the number in 5 guess then game is lost and display the random number.
//? Hint: you can use this code to generate random number 0-100
//? const winingNumber = Math.round(Math.random() * 100);
