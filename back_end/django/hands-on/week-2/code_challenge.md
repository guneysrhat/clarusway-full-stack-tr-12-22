# CC-09 : Coding Challenge Run

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this coding challenge, students will be able to;

- analyze a problem, identify and apply programming knowledge for appropriate solution.

- demonstrate their knowledge of algorithmic design principles by using JavaScript effectively.

## Problem Statement

1. Write a Python code that counts how many vowels and constants a string has that a user entered.

   - Example: 

   ```bash
   text : Today is Saturday
   Your text has 6 vowels and 9 constants
   ```

2. Write a Python code to copy all of contents of dict1 to dict2 by doubling value numbers at below. 

   - Sample array:

   ```python
   dict1 = {'Apple': 15, 'Orange': 35, 'Melon': 20, 'Banana': 50, 'Pear': 40}  
   ```

   - Expected Output :"Red, Green, White, Black"

   ```python
   dict2 = {'Apple': 30, 'Orange': 70, 'Melon': 40, 'Banana': 100, 'Pear': 80}
   ```

3. Ask user to enter a word, a separator and number of repetitions. Write a Python code displaying the word with repetition times and having each word separated with separator character. 

   - For example, if user entered: 

      - word as Tina, 
      - separator as !
      - repetitions as 3 

   - expected output:

      "Tina!Tina!Tina"  

      Be careful there is no separator character at the end.

4. Write a Python code to sort by year descending below list of used car dictionaries using Lambda.

   - sample dict:

      ```python
      cars = [{'make':'Ford', 'model':'F150 XLT','year':2018, 'color':'Gray'}, \
              {'make':'Porsche', 'model':'Cayman GT4', 'year':2016, 'color':'Gold'}, \
              {'make':'Audi', 'model': 'S7 Prestige', 'year':2017, 'color':'Blue'},\
              {'make':'Mercedes', 'model': 'S550', 'year':2019, 'color':'Black'}]
      ```

      

5. Write Python code to convert below JSON data to Python Object, and print this Python Object.

   - Sample JSON

     ```python
     json_car =  '{ "Make":"Mercedes", "Model":"E-200", "Year":2015 }'
     # pay attention this is a string
     ```

6. This is an interview question asked by Facebook.

   - Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded.

   - For example, the message '111' would give 3, since it could be decoded as 'aaa', 'ka', and 'ak'.

   - You can assume that the messages are decodable. For example, '001' is not allowed.

7. This is an interview question asked by Twitter.

   - Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix.

   - For example, given the query string de and the set of strings [dog, deer, deal], return [deer, deal].

8. This is an interview question asked by Amazon.

   - There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.

   - For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:  

   ```bash
   1, 1, 1, 1  
   
   2, 1, 1  
   
   1, 2, 1  
   
   1, 1, 2  
   
   2, 2  
   ```

   

9. This is an interview question asked by Amazon.

   - Given an integer k and a string s, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.

   - For example, given s = "abcba" and k = 2, the longest substring with k distinct characters is "bcb".

10. This is an interview question asked by Google.

   - Given an array of integers and a number k, where 1 <= k <= length of the array, compute the maximum values of each subarray of length k.

   - For example, given array = [10, 5, 2, 7, 8, 7] and k = 3, we should get: [10, 7, 8, 8], since:

   ```bash
   10 = max(10, 5, 2) 
   7 = max(5, 2, 7) 
   8 = max(2, 7, 8) 
   8 = max(7, 8, 7) 
   ```
